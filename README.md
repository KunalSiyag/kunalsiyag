## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🦾 Spectopedia – Smart Glasses with AI Vision  
Accessible wearable that captures scenes via ESP32-CAM and describes them with AI (ChatGPT/Gemini), relaying the output through an I2S audio module. Ideal for visually impaired users and real-time environmental feedback.

### 🧠 Predictive Maintenance + Digital Twin Dashboard  
A machine learning system deployed on AWS that analyzes real-time sensor data from IoT devices. Features a dashboard to manage and simulate multiple "digital twins."

### 🌾 Smart Farming & Food Distribution  
A React Native app for tracking food production, managing distribution, and connecting farmers to buyers. Built to reduce food wastage and increase agricultural efficiency.

### 🔗 Decentralized Freelance Job Escrow (Blockchain)  
A smart contract-based system ensuring trust between freelancers and clients using **dual OTP-based job verification** and conditional payments. Uses Ethereum testnet, Solidity, and MetaMask for DApp interaction.

### .... And Many more

## 🔐 Blockchain Vision

I'm actively exploring the use of **decentralized technology** in areas like:

- **Freelance job security**  
- **Transparent public service platforms**  
- **Decentralized identity for IoT devices**  
- **Asset tokenization in agriculture and investment apps**
